# Knick_Knack_Krafts

## About:
### Built a website for my Mother's craft business using React and Tailwind CSS. React is a Javascript library for creating user interfaces. Tailwind CSS is a framework that allows inline styling without writing custom CSS.

## Components:
### The home page of the website includes an image slider that allows the user to cycle through five different product images. Each product page is the same reusable component of a simple photo gallery. The Contact page utilizes a service called EmailJS to forward the contents of the page form to an email service. Many of the components created for this website were reused for my portfolio website.

## Deployment:
### This project was deployed using the same process and terraform code that I used for The Cloud Resume Challenge. You can find out more about that process in my Cloud-Resume Repository.
